The file dama.py contains the game of checkers, or the slovak version thereof, dÃ¡ma.
Pawns are moved by dragging and dropping, while not being able to be moved on a space that is illegal for them.
Queens are distinguished from the pawns by having a yellow outline.
This is an incomplete version of the game, the features yet to be implemented are:
  > Allowing for multiple jumps in a row
  > Removing pieces that were able to jump, but didn't
  > Tracking points
  > Better control of legal moves

The file mlyn.py contains the game mlyn, or mill.
The pieces are placed on the board in alternating turn order, and the points for each player are tracked
in real time. This version is also incomplete, missing the following:

  > A system of displaying the recources each player has available
